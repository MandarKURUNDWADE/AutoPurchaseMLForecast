# Car Buyer Spending Forecast Project 🚗💰

## 📝 Description 
This project aims to forecast car buyer spending based on various features such as gender, age, annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth.

## 📊 Dataset 
The dataset used for this project is stored in the file "Car_Purchasing_Data.csv."

## 🎯 Approach 
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Displaying and exploring the dataset.
   - Checking for missing values.
   - Feature scaling (Normalization) using MinMaxScaler.

2. Model Selection and Training:
   - Linear Regression
   - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor
   - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

3. Model Evaluation:
   - Using R-squared score as the evaluation metric.

## 📥 Installations 
To run the code, you need to install the required Python libraries. Use the following command to install the dependencies:

```
pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow keras
```

## ⚙️ Setup 
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the "Car_Purchasing_Data.csv" file in the project directory.

## 🛠️ Requirements 
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## 🚀 Technology Used 
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## ▶️ Run
To run the project, execute the "code-Notebook" script. It will perform data preprocessing, train the models, and display the R-squared score for each model. Additionally, it will create an ANN model and save it for future use.

For GUI Application:
1. Run the "code-Notebook".
2. Enter the required input (gender, age, annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth).
3. Click the "Predict" button to see the car purchase amount prediction.
